<section class="about-me">

<p>I think I’ve been a designer since I can remember.</p>

<p>At that time - pre-school - my drawings were a bit advanced for my age (I even risk saying that I was better at hand drawing then).</p>

<p>Time passed, “arts” kept in my veins, and I enroled college to become a Designer.</p>

<p>Graphic, Interiors, Fashion, Web...I’ve done a bit of all by now, being Graphic my, let’s say...favorite.</p>
<p>But I always thought Design should go hand-in-hand with Marketing after all, who do we get the briefings from?</p>

<p>So I decided to learn how my Design impacted the public and actually understand the metrics and what they meant.</p>

<p>I turned to Digital Marketing.</p>

<p>During this time I learned how to manage corporate social media accounts, what was SEO, Ads, Analytics, keywords (really got into copywriting)...the whole shabang.</p>

<p>And there I was, fully digital, and then I thought to myself...</p>

<p>ow that I know my Digital and my Design, I have to go Digital Design!</p>

<p>And it got me here!</p>

<p>So now I’m hoping you give me the opportunity for fulfilling this goal.</p>
