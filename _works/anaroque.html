	<p>A 23 years old luxury furniture brand decided to renew its single page website.</p>
	<p>The idea was to make use of the great interior design images, presenting them full screen everytime possible.</p>
	<p>Dividing the information into pages of interest to their target audience plus creating a blog and media page for dynamic content is the key for this successful portuguese company to showcase its work without leaving the country.</p>
