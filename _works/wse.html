<h1>Rebranding | Wall Street English</h1>

<p>The italian brand Wall Street Institute changed its name to Wall Street English in 2012.</p>
<p>The institutional brand changed into a more modern look and was in need of rebranding all the stationary and merchandising pieces for the students as well.</p>
<p>These are some on the pieces created for WSE Iberia.</p>
