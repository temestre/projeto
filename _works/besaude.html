<h1 class="title">Be Saúde</h1>
<h2 class="title">Stationary</h2>

<p>BE Saúde is a dental and health franchise clinic.</p>
<p>While opening its second branch, it was in need of a small rebranding since the main colors were black and yellow.</p>
<p>By choosing light gray and different tones of blue the idea was to create an image easily relatable to medicine while transmiting some tranquility and confidence.</p>
<p>These are the stationary pieces and the opening promo flyer.</p>
