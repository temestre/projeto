<p>A wedding is a unique occasion in a couple’s life, so every detail has to be special and reflect exactly what the bride and groom want to feel on that day.</p>
<p>The first contact of the guests with the special day is through the “save the date” and invitations.</p>
<p>It’s like a sneak peek into the the actual day.</p>
<p>Tranquility and countryside feel was the mood of the day. A true Alentejo wedding.</p>
